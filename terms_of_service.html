            <p>We operate the mobile application Dream Journal Ultimate (the "App"), as well as any other related
                products and services that refer or link to these legal terms (the "Legal Terms") (collectively, the
                "Services").</p>
            <p>You can contact us by email at team@dreamjournal.co</p>
            <p>These Legal Terms constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on
                behalf of an entity ("you"), and Dream Labs LLC, concerning your access to and use of the Services. You
                agree that by accessing the Services, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these
                Legal Terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM
                USING THE SERVICES AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.</p>
            <p>Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Services from time to time are
                hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make
                changes or modifications to these Legal Terms from time to time. We will alert you about any changes by
                updating the "Last updated" date of these Legal Terms, and you waive any right to receive specific
                notice of each such change. It is your responsibility to periodically review these Legal Terms to stay
                informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have
                accepted, the changes in any revised Legal Terms by your continued use of the Services after the date
                such revised Legal Terms are posted.</p>
            <p>The App and its Services are intended for users who are at least 18 years old.</p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--text-main); margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">1. OUR SERVICES</h3>
            <p>The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person
                or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or
                regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or
                country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on
                their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent
                local laws are applicable.</p>
            <p>The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability
                and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your
                interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use the Services. You may not use the Services
                in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).</p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--text-main); margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">21. INDEMNIFICATION</h3>
            <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless, including our subsidiaries, affiliates, and all of
                our respective officers, agents, partners, and employees, from and against any loss, damage, liability,
                claim, or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, made by any third party due to or
                arising out of: (1) your Contributions; (2) use of the Services; (3) breach of these Legal Terms; (4)
                any breach of your representations and warranties set forth in these Legal Terms; (5) your violation of
                the rights of a third party, including but not limited to intellectual property rights; or (6) any overt
                harmful act toward any other user of the Services with whom you connected via the Services.
                Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense
                and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate, at
                your expense, with our defense of such claims. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such
                claim, action, or proceeding which is subject to this indemnification upon becoming aware of it.</p>

                relates to any activity you have undertaken using the Services. You agree that we shall have no
                liability to you for any loss, corruption of any such data, and you hereby waive any right of action

                hereby waive any rights or requirements under any statutes, regulations, rules, ordinances, or other
                laws in any jurisdiction which require an original signature or delivery or retention of non-electronic
                records, or to payments or the granting of credits by any means other than electronic means.</p>

            <p>These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Services or in respect to the
                Services constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise
                or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or
                provision. These Legal Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all
                of our rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss,
                damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or
                part of a provision of these Legal Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that
                provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Legal Terms and does not affect the
                validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership,
                employment or agency relationship created between you and us as a result of these Legal Terms or use of
                the Services. You agree that these Legal Terms will not be construed against us by virtue of having
                drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of these
                Legal Terms and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Legal Terms.</p>
